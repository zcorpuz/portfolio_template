# portfolio_template

I was tasked to create a professional profile with BootStrap so that the whole portfolio is responsive to different screen sizes. Main page is a basic bio of myself, the portfolio page is empty as I currently do not have any projects to showcase, and the contact page allows you to input a message to reach out me personally.
